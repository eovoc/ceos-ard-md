# Objectives and Needs

The overall objective is to make it easier to find data through the CEOS Connected Data Assets which are CEOS-ARD compliant among the many collections available.
The goal is to achieve this by better specifying thsi information in the collection metadata available in the CEOS Connected Data Assets.
The recommendations can be applied by Data Producers to better describe their collections and will allow the CEOS Connected Data Assets to refine the filtering capabilities available to Data Consumers when searching for compliant data holdings.

## Use Cases

Below is an initial set of use cases.  Not all of these use cases are applicable currently as this may require a refactoring of CEOS-ARD Product Family Specifications into multiple conformance classes.  The use cases refering to compliance classes are a placeholder for a future evolution.

| User Story |	As a …​	 | I want to …​	 | so that I can …​ |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1	 | Data Producer |	advertise compliance with a CEOS-ARD Product Family Specification in my collection's metadata records. | facilitate discovery of my data by data consumers . | 
| 2	 | Data Consumer |	search for available data compliant with a specific CEOS-ARD Product Family Specification. | find suitable data matching my quality requirements. | 
| 3	 | Data Consumer |	understand whether a specific collection provides CEOS-ARD compliant data.  | to consider its use for my analyses. | 
| 4	 | Data Consumer |	find data compliant to a specific CEOS-ARD Product Family specification.  | to consider its use for my analyses. | 
| 5	 | Data Consumer |	find data compliant to a specific version of a CEOS-ARD Product Family specification.  | to consider its use for my analyses. | 
| 6	 | Data Consumer |	find data compliant to specific conformance classes of a specific version of a CEOS-ARD Product Family specification.  | to consider its use for my analyses. | 


Additional use cases cna include:

| User Story |	As a …​	 | I want to …​	 | so that I can …​ |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1	 | Data Consumer |	have access to evaluation method, self assessment results, peer review results. | verify evaluation method and results and compare with alternative collections of the same family. |
