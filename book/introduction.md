# Introduction

## Purpose of the document

This document describes Best Practices for the encoding of metadata for CEOS-ARD Collections to facilitate their discovery through the CEOS Connected Data Assets.

The proposed Best Practices are based on proven approaches used by other communities for expressing conformance with data specifications as part of Quality metadata:

- INSPIRE: to express partial or conformance with respect to the `INSPIRE Data Specifications` {cite}`inspire_dataspecifications`, e.g. "Land cover", "Orthoimagery" etc. 
- DGIWG: to express partial or conformance with respect to its `Data Product Specifications` {cite}`dgiwg_standards` (DPS), e.g. "Defence Gridded Elevation Data Product" (DGED), "Defence Orthoimagery Product" (DOP) or "Elevation Surface Mode" (ESM).

The document does not impose a particular metadata standard, but aims to provide guidance on how to apply the best practices to a number of widely used metadata standards.

The Best Practices are currently limited to `Collection` metadata and do not cover the encoding of metadata for CEOS-ARD `Granules` or `Items`.
